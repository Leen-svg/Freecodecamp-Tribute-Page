  <p>The Bernoulli principle is a simple and useful outcome of Bernoulli’s work in fluid dynamics. In its simple form, it states that the pressure of a fluid decreases as it velocity increases and vice versa. It is the consequence of the conservation of energy and explains many things that occur in nature. </p>
